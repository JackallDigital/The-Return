# The-Return
This was one of the XAMK university projects

It is a text based adventure game that ends where it starts.. at least that was the idea, but I guess I didn't finish implementing that.

The game implements different scenes, text based commands, inventory system, enemy, pickups and other interactions.

To make this a real "Return" game I had the ideas to have the player write out their name, and upon completion their name would be saved into the plaque.
So when the returner comes back to the island they can read their name in the plaque.
